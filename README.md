Hello, this is a device booking service which allows to book one of a few mobile devices and then return it

To run the service locally run the docker compose command into the dev directory and then run the service

FonoAPI unfortunately dead and there are no free analogs so wiremock server used

Three hours isn't much to create a project so there are some suggestions:

To be implemented:
1. caching using Redis
2. Spring security with user auth
3. more profound tests because current are quite superficial
